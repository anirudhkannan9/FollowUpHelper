Roadmap:
- Filtering display of saved/added people.  Filters: "All" "LinkedIn" etc.
- Delete someone from the list by pressing '-' (including a confirmation dialog)
- Edit the note by clicking a pencil icon
- Add a Loom about how to use this Chrome Extension to this README file. Order of Loom: Use case / why & how I use this (30-60s), then installation instructions.


Distant roadmap:
- Instead of saving data to JSON (and reloading data from JSON), some kind of account management functionality?
- Reminders: "it's been x days/weeks since you added X. Do you want to follow up with them?"
- Email follow-up support. Every time you send an email, you can activate the extension and it will note the email you sent from, the recipient address, the date & time, and the subject line. It can remind you to follow-up if they haven't replied (this could be more complicated though -- it might need them to

Changelog/added functionality (not exhaustive):
- Dialog automatically pops up upon LinkedIn connection request being sent.
- Manual adding of URLs for people who you want to save / follow-up with
- Backup & restoration of data via JSON.
- Saved JSONs are saved with some keyword e.g. followuphelper backup so that it's easy for you to find
- Next to the text field for URL for manual input, button to "Add current page URL"
