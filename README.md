Roadmap:
- Next to the text field for URL for manual input, button to "Add URL of current page"
- Filtering display of saved/added people.  Filters: "All" "LinkedIn" etc.
- Save in something besides Chrome Local Storage so that it actually persists when I delete and re-load the extension to test it. Maybe need to enable username & password?
- Delete someone from the list by pressing '-' (including a confirmation dialog)
- Edit the note by clicking a pencil icon
